# Linking to Papers
Often you will be working on a separate paper or multiple papers that leverage the results in this project repo. Typically, we would write the papers in Overleaf. Rather than duplicating those here, we can just directly link to those papers via the `git submodule` function, and this way we can make it easy to re-upload figures or other experimental results by copying it directly into the relevant submodule and then changing directories into the paper and re-uploading. To do this, we would first create the paper in overleaf and then use the `git submodule` command as following to begin linking the paper. For example:
```
git submodule add https://git.overleaf.com/5f3141ba7d778f00014ad967 DiverseOptGP
```
where the second argument is the overleaf git clone id from your overleaf paper and the fourth argument is some human-readable and understandable short code for your paper. (If you skip this forth argument then you will have a confusing hash sub-folder, which, while functional, may not be the easiest to track or explore by a human.) You can add multiple papers if you have several that leverage the results in this repository by creating several sub-modules as sub-folders. Changes you make to the paper will not be tracked here. Note that you will have to authenticate with your Overleaf username and password to be able to clone or submodule any of the overleaf repositories.
